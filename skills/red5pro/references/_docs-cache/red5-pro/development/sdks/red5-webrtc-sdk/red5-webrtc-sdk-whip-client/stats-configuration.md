## Stats Configuration

The configuration used for statistics monitoring has the following structure:

```js
{
  // Optional.
  // If provided, it will POST stats to this endpoint.
  // If undefined, it will post stats to message transport.
  // If null, it will only emit status events.
  endpoint: undefined,
  additionalHeaders: undefined,
  interval: 5000, // Interval to poll stats, in milliseconds.
  include: [], // Empty array allows SDK to be judicious about what stats to include.
}
```

### endpoint

- If the `endpoint` is defined, the SDK will attempt to make `POST` requests with a JSON body representing each individual report.
- If the `endpoint` is left `undefined`, the SDK will post metadata with type `stats-report` on the underlying message transport (DataChannel) if available.
- If the `endpoint` is set to `null`, the SDK will only emit events with the metadata on the `WebRTC.StatsReport` event.

### additionalHeaders

By default, if an `endpoint` is defined, the `POST` request body will be in JSON and have the `{ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }` header set. If requirements - such as authentication - are required, a map of additional headers can be provided to be sent along with the request.

### interval

The polling interval (in milliseconds) to access the `RTCStatsReport` from the underlying `RTCPeerConnection` of the publisher client.

### include

An array of static type strings. These directly map to the listing of type available for `RTCStatsReport` objects. If left empty or undefined, the SDK will report the statistics it deems suitable for tracking proper broadcast conditions.

e.g.,

```js
include: ["outbound-rtp", "transport"];
```
